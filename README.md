## Description

This is a simple TODO task management API built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and PostgreSQL. It provides CRUD operations for managing tasks, using TypeORM for database interactions.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

## Database Setup

This application uses PostgreSQL as its database. A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to easily set up the database.

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the PostgreSQL container.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content (adjust if necessary):

```
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USER=user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=example
DATABASE_NAME=todo_db
```

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints for managing tasks:

- `GET /tasks`: Retrieve all tasks
- `GET /tasks/:id`: Retrieve a specific task by ID
- `POST /tasks`: Create a new task (body: { title: string, description?: string, completed?: boolean })
- `PATCH /tasks/:id`: Update a task (body: partial of create fields)
- `DELETE /tasks/:id`: Delete a task

## Suggestions

Here are some suggestions to improve this project:
- Add user authentication and authorization to secure the API.
- Implement pagination and filtering for the `GET /tasks` endpoint.
- Add more task fields like due dates, priorities, or categories.
- Integrate a frontend application (e.g., with React or Angular) to consume the API.
- Add more comprehensive error handling and validation.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
